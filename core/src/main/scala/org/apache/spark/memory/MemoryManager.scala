/**
 * An abstract memory manager that enforces how memory is shared between execution and storage.
 *
 * In this context, execution memory refers to that used for computation in shuffles, joins,
 * sorts and aggregations, while storage memory refers to that used for caching and propagating
 * internal data across the cluster. There exists one MemoryManager per JVM.
 *
 * The MemoryManager abstract base class itself implements policies for sharing execution memory
 * between tasks; it tries to ensure that each task gets a reasonable share of memory, instead of
 * some task ramping up to a large amount first and then causing others to spill to disk repeatedly.
 * If there are N tasks, it ensures that each task can acquire at least 1 / 2N of the memory
 * before it has to spill, and at most 1 / N. Because N varies dynamically, we keep track of the
 * set of active tasks and redo the calculations of 1 / 2N and 1 / N in waiting tasks whenever
 * this set changes. This is all done by synchronizing access to mutable state and using wait() and
 * notifyAll() to signal changes to callers. Prior to Spark 1.6, this arbitration of memory across
 * tasks was performed by the ShuffleMemoryManager.
